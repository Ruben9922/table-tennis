# Table Tennis
Simple table tennis game. Hit the ball into the opponent's goal to increase your score, while defending your own goal.

## Controls
**Move the mouse up or down to control the left bat**, and **left or right to control the right bat**.  
I'll change this to use keyboard input soon, as using mouse input to control both bats like this is confusing (but does make the game more interesting especially if playing against yourself :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:).

## Future Updates
*   Allow user to specify horizontal speed and maximum vertical speed
*   Change so bats are controlled by keyboard input rather than by the mouse as mentioned above
